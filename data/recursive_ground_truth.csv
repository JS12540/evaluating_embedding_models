1,"Describe the specific policies and controls available to prevent data loss and control information flow from the Acme application on unmanaged, employee-owned mobile devices. Detail how data can be contained within the application and what actions can be taken if a device is compromised or lost.","[{'chunk_id': 'chunk_26', 'text': 'Acme helps prevent the inadvertent or malicious exfiltration of sensitive data.\nDLP Integration: Our APIs allow for integration with leading Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) and DLP solutions. These tools can monitor messages and files in real-time for sensitive content (e.g., credit card numbers, social security numbers, confidential keywords) and take automated action, such as redacting the message or alerting an administrator.\nGranular File Sharing Controls: Administrators can set policies to restrict file sharing from unmanaged devices or block the upload/download of specific file types.'}, {'chunk_id': 'chunk_54', 'text': 'Acme provides a secure and manageable mobile experience, giving IT administrators the controls they need to protect corporate data on both corporate-owned and employee-owned (BYOD) devices.'}, {'chunk_id': 'chunk_55', 'text': 'The Acme mobile application for iOS and Android is fully compatible with leading Unified Endpoint Management (UEM) solutions, supporting both Mobile Device Management (MDM) and Mobile Application Management (MAM) policies.\nMDM: For corporate-owned devices, administrators can use their MDM solution to deploy, configure, and secure the entire device, including the Acme app.\nMAM (App Protection Policies): For BYOD scenarios, MAM allows administrators to apply security controls specifically to the Acme application and its data, without managing the user''s entire personal device. This ""containerization"" approach protects corporate data while respecting employee privacy.\nWe officially support and test against major UEM platforms, including:\nMicrosoft Intune\nVMware Workspace ONE\nMobileIron\nJamf'}, {'chunk_id': 'chunk_56', 'text': 'Through your UEM provider, you can enforce a wide range of granular security policies on the Acme mobile app:'}]","This question asks about mobile device data loss prevention and controls for BYOD devices. Chunk_26 covers DLP integration and file sharing controls including restrictions on unmanaged devices. Chunk_54 introduces mobile enterprise management for BYOD. Chunk_55 details MAM policies for BYOD scenarios explaining containerization and supported UEM platforms. Chunk_56 mentions granular security policies enforceable through UEM providers. These chunks together address policies, controls, data containment, and actions for compromised devices."
2,"What is Acme's guiding architectural philosophy for security? Describe the core principles of this architecture, such as how it redefines the security perimeter and its approach to access control.","[{'chunk_id': 'chunk_43', 'text': 'Acme''s infrastructure and application architecture are guided by a Zero Trust philosophy. This means we do not automatically trust any user or service, whether internal or external to our network. Every access request is authenticated, authorized, and encrypted before being granted.\nKey principles of our Zero Trust implementation include:\nIdentity as the Perimeter: Access controls are based on verified user and device identity, not network location.\nLeast Privilege Access: Services and employees are granted the absolute minimum level of access required to perform their function.\nMicro-segmentation: Our production network is segmented into smaller, isolated zones. A compromise in one zone is contained and cannot easily spread to others.\nContinuous Verification: We continuously monitor and validate user and device state, revoking access if anomalous behavior is detected.'}]","This question specifically asks about Acme's guiding architectural philosophy for security. Chunk_43 directly answers this by stating that Acme's infrastructure is guided by Zero Trust philosophy. It explicitly describes the core principles including how it redefines the security perimeter (Identity as the Perimeter vs network location) and its approach to access control (Least Privilege Access, authentication/authorization/encryption for every request). The chunk also covers micro-segmentation and continuous verification which are key architectural principles."
3,Our security operations team requires deep integration for monitoring user and administrative activity. Describe the platform's native capabilities for exporting detailed audit logs and the specific mechanisms or connectors provided for integration with enterprise Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platforms.,"[{'chunk_id': 'chunk_50', 'text': 'Acme provides detailed, human-readable audit logs that capture a wide range of activities within your enterprise instance. These logs are essential for security investigations, compliance audits, and internal monitoring.\nKey Logged Events Include:\nUser Activity: User login success/failure, password changes, MFA enrollment, profile changes.\nAdministrative Actions: Changes to user roles/permissions, security settings (e.g., SSO configuration), compliance settings (e.g., retention policy changes), and integration approvals.\nChannel & File Activity: Channel creation/deletion/archiving, user joins/leaves, file uploads/downloads, changes to public/private status.\nAccess & Export: Activity from eDiscovery tools, legal hold actions, and data exports.\nIntegration and Access:\nAudit Log API: All audit events are accessible via a dedicated, secure API.\nSIEM Integration: We provide pre-built connectors and support standardized formats (e.g., CEF, LEEF) for seamless integration with major Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platforms like Splunk, QRadar, and Microsoft Sentinel. This allows your security team to correlate Acme activity with data from other systems in a single pane of glass.'}]","This question asks about audit log capabilities and SIEM integration mechanisms. Chunk_50 comprehensively addresses this by detailing the types of logged events (user activity, administrative actions, channel/file activity, access/export), describing the native Audit Log API for exporting logs, and specifically explaining SIEM integration capabilities including pre-built connectors, standardized formats (CEF, LEEF), and support for major SIEM platforms (Splunk, QRadar, Microsoft Sentinel). This single chunk fully answers all aspects of the question."
4,"For compliance purposes, we must enforce policies that actively prevent communication between specific user groups. What platform feature allows an administrator to create such a policy, and what is the user experience for individuals in groups where this communication control is enforced?","[{'chunk_id': 'chunk_49', 'text': 'For organizations in finance, legal, and other regulated industries, Acme provides an Information Barriers feature (also known as Ethical Walls). This allows compliance administrators to prevent specific groups of users from communicating with each other when a conflict of interest exists.\nWhen an Information Barrier policy is active between two groups (e.g., an M&A advisory team and a trading desk):\nUsers in one group cannot initiate a Direct Message with users in the other group.\nUsers cannot be added to the same private channel.\nUsers from one group will not see users from the other group in search results or @mentions.\nThis feature is critical for preventing insider trading and adhering to regulations like FINRA Rule 2241.'}]","This question asks about a feature to prevent communication between user groups and the user experience. Chunk_49 directly answers both aspects by naming the Information Barriers (Ethical Walls) feature that administrators use to create such policies. It explicitly details the user experience when these policies are active: users cannot initiate DMs with restricted groups, cannot be added to same private channels, and will not see restricted users in search results or mentions. This chunk fully addresses the compliance use case and regulatory context."
5,"Beyond the governance of customer data used by AI features, what is Acme's framework for the responsible development of the AI models themselves? Specifically, what is your policy regarding the sourcing of training data for global models, and what governance processes are in place to validate models for fairness and bias before deployment?","[{'chunk_id': 'chunk_51', 'text': 'As AI becomes integral to the Acme platform, we are committed to its ethical and responsible development and deployment. Our approach is built on transparency, accountability, and control.'}, {'chunk_id': 'chunk_52', 'text': 'The development of all Acme Intelligence features is governed by a strict internal AI Ethics Framework. This framework is overseen by our cross-functional AI Ethics Council and is based on four core principles:\nFairness & Impartiality: We actively work to identify and mitigate harmful biases in our training data and models to ensure our AI features perform equitably for all users, regardless of demographic background.\nTransparency & Explainability: We",
