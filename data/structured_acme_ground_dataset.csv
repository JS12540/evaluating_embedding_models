2,"What is Acme's guiding architectural philosophy for security? Describe the core principles of this architecture, such as how it redefines the security perimeter and its approach to access control.","[{'chunk_id': 'acme_12.1', 'text': ""Acme's infrastructure and application architecture are guided by a Zero Trust philosophy. This means we do not automatically trust any user or service, whether internal or external to our network. Every access request is authenticated, authorized, and encrypted before being granted.\nKey principles include Identity as the Perimeter, Least Privilege Access, Micro-segmentation, and Continuous Verification.""}, {'chunk_id': 'acme_5.2', 'text': 'Single Sign-On (SSO): Integrate with your existing identity provider (e.g., Okta, Azure AD, Ping Identity) via SAML 2.0 or OpenID Connect for centralized and secure user authentication.\nMulti-Factor Authentication (MFA): Enforce MFA for all users to add a critical layer of security beyond passwords.\nRole-Based Access Control (RBAC): Assign granular permissions to users and administrators. Define custom roles to control who can create channels, manage users, access compliance tools, or configure integrations.\nSCIM Provisioning: Automate user lifecycle management. Automatically create, update, and deactivate user accounts in Acme as they are changed in your central identity provider.'}]","These sections explicitly define Acme’s Zero Trust Architecture principles (identity as perimeter, least privilege, continuous verification) and access control mechanisms such as IAM, SSO, and RBAC."
3,Our security operations team requires deep integration for monitoring user and administrative activity. Describe the platform's native capabilities for exporting detailed audit logs and the specific mechanisms or connectors provided for integration with enterprise Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platforms.,"[{'chunk_id': 'acme_13.3', 'text': 'Acme provides detailed, human-readable audit logs that capture a wide range of activities within your enterprise instance. These logs are essential for security investigations, compliance audits, and internal monitoring.\nKey Logged Events Include:\n● User Activity: User login success/failure, password changes, MFA enrollment, profile changes.\n● Administrative Actions: Changes to user roles/permissions, security settings (e.g., SSO configuration), compliance settings (e.g., retention policy changes), and integration approvals.\n● Channel & File Activity: Channel creation/deletion/archiving, user joins/leaves, file uploads/downloads, changes to public/private status.\n● Access & Export: Activity from eDiscovery tools, legal hold actions, and data exports.\nIntegration and Access:\n● Audit Log API: All audit events are accessible via a dedicated, secure API.\n● SIEM Integration: We provide pre-built connectors and support standardized formats (e.g., CEF, LEEF) for seamless integration with major Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platforms like Splunk, QRadar, and Microsoft Sentinel. This allows your security team to correlate Acme activity with data from other systems in a single pane of glass.'}, {'chunk_id': 'acme_12.2', 'text': 'Acme’s security team operates a proactive threat intelligence program using OSINT, commercial feeds, and ISAC participation to anticipate and defend against emerging threats. Insights are used to enrich SIEM rules and improve defensive strategies.'}]","Chunk 13.3 describes detailed audit logs, event coverage, and SIEM connectors. Chunk 12.2 complements it by explaining the proactive threat intelligence program feeding SIEM for monitoring."
4,"For compliance purposes, we must enforce policies that actively prevent communication between specific user groups. What platform feature allows an administrator to create such a policy, and what is the user experience for individuals in groups where this communication control is enforced?","[{'chunk_id': 'acme_13.2', 'text': 'For organizations in finance, legal, and other regulated industries, Acme provides an Information Barriers feature (also known as Ethical Walls). This allows compliance administrators to prevent specific groups of users from communicating with each other when a conflict of interest exists.\nWhen an Information Barrier policy is active between two groups (e.g., an M&A advisory team and a trading desk):\n● Users in one group cannot initiate a Direct Message with users in the other group.\n● Users cannot be added to the same private channel.\n● Users from one group will not see users from the other group in search results or @mentions.\nThis feature is critical for preventing insider trading and adhering to regulations like FINRA Rule 2241.'}]","Chunk 13.2 outlines the Information Barriers (Ethical Walls) feature, describing enforcement between user groups and user experience restrictions like blocked DMs and invisible search results."
5,"Beyond the governance of customer data used by AI features, what is Acme's framework for the responsible development of the AI models themselves? Specifically, what is your policy regarding the sourcing of training data for global models, and what governance processes are in place to validate models for fairness and bias before deployment?","[{'chunk_id': 'acme_14', 'text': 'Acme commits to ethical and transparent AI practices built on fairness, accountability, and user control.'}, {'chunk_id': 'acme_14.1', 'text': 'The development of all Acme Intelligence features is governed by a strict internal AI Ethics Framework. This framework is overseen by our cross-functional AI Ethics Council and is based on four core principles:\n1. Fairness & Impartiality: We actively work to identify and mitigate harmful biases in our training data and models to ensure our AI features perform equitably for all users, regardless of demographic background.\n2. Transparency & Explainability: We strive to be transparent about how our AI features work. Where possible, we provide users with insight into why an AI-driven suggestion or summary was generated.\n3. Accountability & Human-in-the-Loop: We believe AI should augment, not replace, human judgment. Our systems are designed to keep humans in control, with clear mechanisms for users to provide feedback, override suggestions, and report issues.\n4. Privacy & Security by Design: As detailed in Section 4.4, our AI systems are built with privacy as a foundational requirement. We use techniques like data minimization and single-tenant processing to protect customer data.'}, {'chunk_id': 'acme_14.2', 'text': 'Our machine learning models undergo a rigorous governance and validation lifecycle before being deployed to production.\n● Data Sourcing: As stated previously, we have a strict policy against using any customer\'s message or file content to train our global, multi-tenant AI models. Models are trained on anonymized, aggregated usage data or on publicly available and permissively licensed datasets.\n● Bias Testing & Red Teaming: Before release, models are subjected to extensive testing to detect and mitigate performance disparities across different user groups. Our security team also conducts ""AI red teaming"" exercises to identify potential ways the models could be abused or manipulated.\n● Continuous Monitoring: Once in production, we continuously monitor model performance, data drift, and user feedback to ensure the models continue to operate as intended and to identify areas for improvement.'}]","These sections cover the Responsible AI framework, including data sourcing restrictions, fairness/bias validation, ethics principles, and ongoing model governance practices."
