Transparency & Explainability: We strive to be transparent about how our AI features work. Where possible, we provide users with insight into why an AI-driven suggestion or summary was generated.\n3. Accountability & Human-in-the-Loop: We believe AI should augment, not replace, human judgment. Our systems are designed to keep humans in control, with clear mechanisms for users to provide feedback, override suggestions, and report issues.\n4. Privacy & Security by Design: As detailed in Section 4.4, our AI systems are built with privacy as a foundational requirement.
