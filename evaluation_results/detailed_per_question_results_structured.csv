We provide a unified, secure, and intelligent environment where teams can connect, collaborate, and innovate. Our platform is more than just a messaging app; it is a central hub for work, integrating seamlessly with the tools your organization already uses.\nThis document outlines the four pillars of the Acme Enterprise offering:\nIntuitive Collaboration: A feature-rich suite of tools designed to make communication effortless and organized, from real-time messaging and video huddles to asynchronous threaded conversations and powerful workflow automation.\nUncompromising Security: A multi-layered security architecture that protects your data at every stage. From end-to-end encryption options to granular access controls and proactive threat monitoring, security is embedded in our DNA.\nVerifiable Compliance: A commitment to meeting the world\'s most stringent regulatory standards, including SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001, GDPR, and HIPAA. We provide the tools necessary for data governance, eDiscovery, and legal holds.\nIntelligent Productivity: Leveraging the power of our proprietary AI, ""Acme Intelligence,"" we transform communication data into actionable insights, automate routine tasks, and help users find the information they need, instantly.\nAcme is built for the scale, complexity, and security demands of the modern enterprise. We empower your workforce to be more productive while providing your IT and security teams with the control and visibility they require.\n2. Introduction to Acme'}, {'chunk_id': 'acme_3.1', 'text': ""Channels: Organize conversations around projects, teams, or topics. Channels can be public for transparency or private for sensitive discussions. Guest and shared channels allow for secure collaboration with external partners and vendors.\nThreads: Keep conversations focused and uncluttered by replying directly to messages. Threads make it easy to follow complex discussions without overwhelming the main channel view.\nDirect Messages (DMs): For one-on-one or small group conversations, DMs provide a private and direct line of communication.\nHuddles: Instantly start a lightweight audio or video call directly from any channel or DM. Huddles are perfect for quick, spontaneous discussions that are faster than typing but don't require a formal meeting. Screen sharing and multi-person participation are fully supported.\nRich Messaging: Communicate with clarity using features like @mentions, emoji reactions, rich text formatting, code snippets, and user status updates.""}, {'chunk_id': 'acme_13', 'text': 'Acme provides enterprise administrators with powerful tools to enforce corporate and regulatory data handling policies.'}, {'chunk_id': 'acme_4.4', 'text': 'Our AI capabilities are built on a foundation of trust and control.\nCompliance-Aware AI: All AI features respect the underlying data governance and compliance settings of your organization. For example, if a user is part of a legal hold, their data is excluded from summarization models to maintain data integrity.\nData Isolation: Enterprise customer data is processed in single-tenant, isolated environments. Your data is never co-mingled or used to train models for other customers. This is a core tenet of our security posture.\nAdmin Controls: Administrators have full control to enable or disable specific AI features on an organizational or per-user group basis.\n5. Enterprise-Grade Security\nSecurity is not a feature at Acme; it is the foundation upon which our platform is built. We employ a defense-in-depth strategy, layering multiple physical, technical, and administrative controls to protect customer data. Our security program is managed by a dedicated team under the direction of our Chief Security Officer (CSO).'}]",1.0,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.2,1.0,1.0,1.0
